## 🖥 Introduction 🖥
This project contains four different and independent exercises. The concept is simple, I have been hired by Mr. Robot to help him in his adventures. I have to help him code four algorithms in Python that will be described later on.

## 🖥 Exercices 🖥
### Card generator
This algorithm can generate credit card numbers. First of Mr. Robot can choose if he wants a visa or a mastercard. He just has to type the corresponding number (1 for Visa and 2 for Mastercard). Then, depending on the choice made previously, the card will start with a 4 (Visa) or a 5 (Mastercard). To be more readable, the card will be generated without and with spaces (ex : 0000000000000000 and 0000 0000 0000 0000). To do so, the algorithm generates four four-digit numbers. Of course, even Mr. Robot can make a mistake such as a typo, so he will be given another chance if he did as such.

### Password generator
This algorithm allows Mr. Robot to generate a password. Before generating the password, he will be given a choice. He just has to type 1, 2 or 3 depending on the type of password he wants. Indeed, three types of password are available. The first one is a random password composed of letters and numbers. The second one is a random password with at least an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and a digit. The last one is a secure password (cryptographically strong). After choosing the type, he will be able to choose the length of the password.


### Pin code
Mr. Robot lost his password. Yes, it can happen to the best of us. I know what you might think but no he can't just click on "forgotten password" so here I am helping him. Fortunately, he gave me the hashed version of his eight-digit password, so it can easily be found by generating and testing various possibilities. He just has to run the program.

### Binary to hexadecimal
Mr. Robot ~~hacked~~ found a server containing a file written in binary. He wants to convert it to hexadecimal to reduce
its size. With this program, he just has to enter the binary number and it will be converted automatically.
